# Data Providence

This is the original Clark County data downloaded from their election website:

[Clark County](https://www.clarkcountynv.gov/) and specifically the file 
[https://elections.clarkcountynv.gov/electionresultsTV/cvr/24G/24G_CVRExport_NOV_Final_Confidential.zip](https://elections.clarkcountynv.gov/electionresultsTV/cvr/24G/24G_CVRExport_NOV_Final_Confidential.zip) 
(location of which is subject to change by Clark County)

The original file was too large to upload to GitHub so it was reduced and cut up between president and senate and unncessary columns removed, other than that, the data wasn't modified.
The goal is to take this data and reproduce the graphs produced in our analysis.
