# 2024 Election Analysis

The Election Truth Alliance is a non-profit, non-partisan organization founded in December of 2024 when multiple individuals came together to share independent data, analysis, and research into the results of the 2024 US Presidential Election. As concerning trends emerged from our shared data we moved quickly, at the speed of trust, to make our findings more accessible and understandable to the broader public.

We are a group of passionate volunteers who are committed to making a positive impact in our elections. In particular, we have brought together individuals with data analysis and cyber skills to identify potential manipulation or anomalies. Our aim is to ensure that the public is equipped with vital information about the security, integrity, and legitimacy of their vote. 

In todayâ€™s landscape of pervasive disinformation, misinformation, and 'weaponized unreality', we believe the truth still matters. This is why we've created this repository. We want to be completely transparent about where we've gotten our data and the how we've performed the analysis. Our analysis is completely reproducible.

Currently we have the following information about the following swing states:
